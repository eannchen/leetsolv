## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Zero Dependencies Philosophy
**üöÄ Pure Go Implementation**: LeetSolv is built entirely in Go without any external dependencies. This approach offers several advantages:

- **DSA Learning**: Implement every data structure and algorithm from scratch for deep understanding
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune implementations beyond theoretical complexity (e.g., heap operations use O(log n) instead of O(log n) + O(log n))
- **Full Control**: Complete visibility and control over every algorithm's behavior
- **Easy Customization**: Developers can easily modify the SRS algorithm or create clones in other languages
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning how algorithms work in practice rather than just using them

2. **Memory Multipliers**: Adjust intervals based on memory performance
3. **Familiarity Adjustments**: Early difficulty signals affect scheduling
4. **Ease Factor Management**: Dynamic adjustment of review intervals
