[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/eannchen/leetsolv)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/eannchen/leetsolv)

**LeetSolv** is a CLI tool for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problem revision with **spaced repetition**. It's powered by a customized [SuperMemo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo) algorithm that incorporates variables such as **familiarity**, **importance**, and **reasoning**. This approach moves beyond rote memorization, helping you to master complex algorithms through **deliberate practice**.

*Curious how this compares to tools like Anki? See the [FAQ](#faq).*

> ***0️⃣ Zero Dependencies Philosophy**: Implemented entirely in pure Go with no third-party libraries, APIs, or external tools. Even some standard packages are avoided to give full control over the underlying implementations—highlighting the project’s focus on fundamentals. For more details, see [MOTIVATION.md](document/MOTIVATION.md)*.

**The LeetSolv Workflow:**

## Review Scheduling System

### Adaptive SM-2 Algorithm

When a problem is added, LeetSolv applies the SM-2 algorithm with custom factors—**familiarity** (5 levels), **importance** (4 levels), and **reasoning** (3 levels) to calculate the next review date. And a **randomization** is applied to avoid bunching reviews into same days. This design reinforces the goal of mastering data structures and algorithms **through reasoning rather than rote recall**.


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Add a DSA Problem to LeetSolv] --> B[Algorithm Applies Adaptations]
    B --> C[Familiarity Scale]
    B --> D[Importance Scale]
    B --> E[Reasoning Scale]
    B --> F[Due Penalty, optional]
    B --> G[Randomization, optional]


    H[Algorithm Calculates with SM-2 Ease Factor]
    C --> H
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Determine Next Review]
```

> *Check here to learn more about the algorithm: [Interval Growth Curve](#interval-growing-curve)*


### Due Priority Scoring
With SM-2, due reviews can easily accumulate since users have varying schedules and study habits. To address this challenge, LeetSolv introduces a due priority scoring feature that **allows users to prioritize due questions based on a priority score**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Question] --> B[Priority Score Calculation]
    B --> C[Importance Weight]
    B --> D[Overdue Weight]
    B --> E[Familiarity Weight]
    B --> F[Review Count]
    B --> G[Ease Factor]

    C --> H[Final Priority Score]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Sort by Score]
    I --> J[Top-K Due Questions]
    I --> K[Top-K Upcoming Questions]
```

> *By default, the priority score is calculated using the following formula: (1.5×Importance)+(0.5×Overdue Days)+(3.0×Familiarity)+(-1.5×Review Count)+(-1.0×Ease Factor)*

**Due priority list demo:**
![Demo](document/image/DEMO_due_scoring.gif)

### Interval Growing Curve

This system helps you prioritize problems and manage your review schedule efficiently, even with limited study time.

Your **review intervals** are automatically set based on a problem's **importance**. This interval then expands over time based on your **familiarity** and **reasoning** level with the problem.

This means you can:

- **Build a strong foundation**: Prioritize *NeetCode Blind 75* or *NeetCode 150* to build a foundation, and use *NeetCode 250* for extra practice.
- **Target specific goals**: Prioritize problems from company-specific lists for upcoming interviews.

**Critical problems are reviewed more often, while less important ones get longer intervals.**

The following graphs demonstrate how review intervals grow over time for different importance levels, showing the default growth pattern:

![SM2 Critical](document/image/SM2_CRITICAL.png)
**Critical Problems**: Shortest intervals with frequent reviews to ensure mastery of the most important concepts.

![SM2 High](document/image/SM2_HIGH.png)
**High Importance**: Moderate intervals balance frequency for important problems.

![SM2 Medium](document/image/SM2_MEDIUM.png)
**Medium Importance**: Standard intervals for regular practice.

![SM2 Low](document/image/SM2_LOW.png)
**Low Importance**: Longer intervals for problems that require less frequent review.

## Problem Management

### Core Functionalities

- **CRUD + Undo**: Easily **create**, **view**, **update**, and **delete** your problems. You can also **undo** your last action.
- **Trie-Based Search**: Instantly find problems with **blazing-fast search and filtering** by keyword, importance, familiarity, and more.
- **Quick Views**: Get a **summary** of all your problems, including those that are due soon, or view a full **paginated list**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Command] --> B{Command Type}
    B -->|Search/List| C[Apply Filters & Search] --> D[Trie-Based Search] --> E[Paginate Results]
    B -->|Add/Update| F[Schedule Review by SM-2 Algorithm] --> I[Upsert Data & Index]
    B -->|Remove| G[Remove Data & Index]
    B -->|Undo| H[Restore Data & Index from History]

    J[Add to History]
    I --> J
    G --> J
```

**Search, History, Delete, Undo functionality demo:**
![Demo](document/image/DEMO_mgmt.gif)

### Data Privacy & Safety

- **No Data Collection**: LeetSolv does not upload user data to the internet.
- **Atomic Writes**: All updates use temporary files with atomic replacement to **guarantee consistency** and **prevent data loss**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write New Data] -->|To| B[Temporary File]
    B --> C[Rename Temporary File]
    C -->|Replaces| D[Original File]
```

### CLI Interface
- **Interactive & Batch Modes**: Work in a **turn-based interactive mode** or run **direct commands** for quick actions.
- **Intuitive Commands**: Use familiar aliases like `ls`, `rm`, and get **color-coded output** for a clear and pleasant experience.

**Pagination demo:**

### FAQ

#### Q: Why use LeetSolv instead of an Anki deck?

A: Anki is excellent for **memorizing facts** that take seconds, **but for DSA, it can be counterproductive**. LeetSolv's custom SM-2 algorithm **spaces out** the review interval and uses your input on **reasoning**, **familiarity**, and a problem's **importance** to create a schedule that deepens your problem-solving ability—not just check if you memorized the answer.

👉 Tip: Use Anki for memorizing facts, but use LeetSolv to schedule deep, deliberate problem-solving sessions.

#### Q: Should I add all my previously solved problems?

A: **No.** LeetSolv is not a solved-problem database — it’s a spaced repetition scheduler.
Only add problems you actually want to revisit. The scheduling algorithm relies on the date you add a problem to calculate reviews, so bulk-adding will create an unrealistic schedule and an overwhelming pile of due problems.

👉 Tip: If you want to review an old problem you solved months ago, just re-solve it first, then add it to LeetSolv on that day. This way the "last seen" date is accurate.

#### Q: After a period of use, I accumulated too many due problems.

A: This is the **nature** of the SM-2 algorithm — if you skip days or add many problems at once, the due list can grow quickly.
To make this manageable, LeetSolv introduces **[Due Priority Scoring](#due-priority-scoring)**, which ranks due problems by importance, familiarity, overdue days, review count, and ease factor.
Instead of clearing everything at once, just focus on the **highest-priority problems** first. The rest can safely wait until later.

👉 Tip: Once you’ve mastered a problem and re-solved it a few times, you can safely remove it from LeetSolv. The goal isn’t to track everything forever, but to focus on problems that still need spaced practice.
