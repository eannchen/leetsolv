# LeetSolv

A sophisticated spaced repetition CLI app, utilizing the [SuperMemo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo) algorithm **with custom adaptations**, is designed to help users master data structures and algorithms by **emphasizing reasoning**.

**0Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Dependencies Philosophy**: Built entirely in pure Go, without any third-party libraries, APIs, or applications, this project aligns with the spirit of learning data structures and algorithms. Even some built-in Go packages for data structure implementations are not used for granular control.

## Features

### Enhanced SM-2 Algorithm

After adding a problem, LeetSolv will employ the SM-2 algorithm, with custom adaptations for familiarity, importance, and reasoning scale, to determine the next review date with ease factor.

- **Ease Factor**: Classic SM-2 algorithm determinant for calculating next review intervals.
- **Familiarity Scale**: 5-level difficulty assessment (VeryHard, Hard, Medium, Easy, VeryEasy) for personal rating.
- **Importance Scale**: 4-tier priority system (Low, Medium, High, Critical) for problem prioritization.
- **Reasoning Scale**: 3-level memory assessment (Reasoned, Partial, Full recall) with penalties for weak reasoning. This aligns with the core spirit of learning data structures and algorithms.
- **Due Penalty (Optional)**: Automatic penalty system for overdue review problems.
- **Randomization (Optional)**: Random scheduling variation to prevent date over-fitting.

    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Determine Next Review]
```

### Due Priority Scoring
Using the SM-2 algorithm, it‚Äôs inevitable to accumulate a significant number of due reviews because individuals have their own unique circumstances and schedules. To address this challenge, LeetSolv introduces a due priority scoring feature that allows users to prioritize due questions based on a priority score.

- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: A combination of importance, familiarity, overdue days, review count, and ease factor determines due priority.


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Question] --> B[Priority Score Calculation]
    B --> C[Importance Weight]
    B --> D[Overdue Weight]
    B --> E[Familiarity Weight]
    B --> F[Review Count]
    B --> G[Ease Factor]

    C --> H[Final Priority Score]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Sort by Score]
    I --> J[Top-K Due Questions]
    I --> K[Top-K Upcoming Questions]
```

> *By default, the priority score is calculated using the following formula: (1.5√óImportance)+(0.5√óOverdue Days)+(3.0√óDifficulty)+(-1.5√óReview Count)+(-1.0√óEase Factor)*



### Problem Management
- **Trie-Based Search & Filtering**: Fast search and filtering by keywords, familiarity, importance, review count, and due status
- **Summary View**: Overview of total problems, due problems, and upcoming problems
- **Pagination**: Efficient navigation for large problem sets
- **Add/Update Problems**: Create or modify problems with URL and notes
- **Remove Problems**: Delete problems by ID and URL
- **History & Undo**: Track changes and revert recent actions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Command] --> B{Command Type}
    B -->|Search/List| C[Apply Filters & Search] --> D[Trie-Based Search] --> E[Paginate Results]
    B -->|Add/Update| F[Schedule Review by SM-2 Algorithm] --> I[Upsert Data & Index]
    B -->|Remove| G[Remove Data & Index]
    B -->|Undo| H[Restore Data & Index from History]

    J[Add to History]
    I --> J
    G --> J
```


### CLI Interface
- **Interactive Mode**: A turn-based dialogue between the user and the program.
- **Batch Mode**: Execute commands directly from the command line
- **Alias Support**: Intuitive shortcuts for convenience (e.g., `ls`, `rm`, `cfg`)
- **Clear Output**: Clean, color-coded output with proper pagination


## SRS Algorithm

LeetSolv implements a customized SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm that adapts review intervals based on problem importance, familiarity, and memory usage. The algorithm ensures that critical problems are reviewed more frequently while allowing easier problems to have longer intervals.

### Interval Growth by Importance Level

The following graphs demonstrate how review intervals grow over time for different importance levels, showing the adaptive nature of the scheduling system:

![SM2 Critical](document/image/SM2_CRITICAL.png)
**Critical Problems**: Shortest intervals with frequent reviews to ensure mastery of the most important concepts.

![SM2 High](document/image/SM2_HIGH.png)
**High Importance**: Moderate intervals balancing frequency with efficiency for important problems.

![SM2 Medium](document/image/SM2_MEDIUM.png)
**Medium Importance**: Standard intervals following classic SM-2 progression for regular practice.

![SM2 Low](document/image/SM2_LOW.png)
**Low Importance**: Longer intervals for problems that require less frequent review.

> Algorithm parameters can be adjusted in the configuration file in future versions.

## Architecture

### Zero Dependencies Philosophy
**üöÄ Pure Go Implementation**: LeetSolv is built entirely in Go without any external dependencies. This approach offers several advantages:

- **DSA Learning**: Implement every data structure and algorithm from scratch for deep understanding
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune implementations beyond theoretical complexity (e.g., heap operations use O(log n) instead of O(log n) + O(log n))
- **Full Control**: Complete visibility and control over every algorithm's behavior
- **Easy Customization**: Developers can easily modify the SRS algorithm or create clones in other languages
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning how algorithms work in practice rather than just using them
