# LeetSolv

A sophisticated spaced repetition command-line tool using SM-2 algorithm with custom adaptations for mastering algorithms and data structures problems.

**üöÄ Zero Dependencies Philosophy**: Built entirely in pure Go, without any third-party libraries, APIs, or applications, this project aligns with the spirit of learning data structures and algorithms. Even some built-in Go packages for data structure implementations are not used for granular control.

## Features

### Enhanced Spaced Repetition

After adding a problem, LeetSolv will employ the SM-2 algorithm, with custom adaptations for familiarity, importance, and reasoning scale, to determine the next review date.

- **Importance Scale**: Prioritize problems based on their importance using a 4-tier importance scale: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.
- **Familiarity Scale**: Rate your familiarity with a problem using a 5-level familiarity scale: VeryHard, VeryEasy, Hard, Medium, and Easy.
- **Reasoning Scale**: Apply a penalty if their reasoning is not strong enough using a 3-level reasoning scale: Reasoned, Partial, and Full recall. This aligns with the core spirit of learning algorithms and data structures.
- **Due Penalty (Optional)**: Apply a penalty if the problem is overdue for review.
- **Interval Randomization (Optional)**: Apply random scheduling to prevent over-fitting to specific dates.


```mermaid

    A[Add a DSA Problem to LeetSolv]
    A --> B[Set Familiarity, Importance, and Reasoning Scale]
    B --> C[SRS Algorithm Calculates Next Review]
    C --> D[Apply Due Penalty, optional]
    D --> E[Apply Interval Randomization, optional]
    E --> F[Algorithm Adjusts Schedule]
    F --> C
```

### Due Priority Scheduling
Accumulating a significant number of pending issues for review is inevitable for a SRS system, as individuals have their own unique circumstances and schedules. To address this challenge, LeetSolv introduces a due priority scheduling feature that enables users to prioritize pending issues based on a priority score.

- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines importance, familiarity, overdue days, review count, and ease factor


```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Question] --> B[Priority Score Calculation]
    B --> C[Importance Weight]
    B --> D[Overdue Weight]
    B --> E[Familiarity Weight]
    B --> F[Review Count]
    B --> G[Ease Factor]

    C --> H[Final Priority Score]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Sort by Score]
    I --> J[Top-K Due Questions]
    I --> K[Top-K Upcoming Questions]
```

> *By default, the priority score is calculated using the following formula: (1.5√óImportance)+(0.5√óOverdue Days)+(3.0√óDifficulty)+(-1.5√óReview Count)+(-1.0√óEase Factor)*



### Problem Management
- **Trie-Based Search & Filtering**: Search and filter problems by keywords, familiarity, importance, review count, and due status
- **Summary View**: Display a concise summary of total problems, due problems, and upcoming problems
- **Pagination Control**: Efficient handling of large problem sets
- **Add/Update Problems**: Add or update a problem with URL and notes
- **Remove Problems**: Remove a problem by ID and URL
- **History Tracking & Undo Capability**: Track all changes and allow undoing from recent actions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Command] --> B{Command Type}
    B -->|Search/List| D[Apply Filters & Search]
    B -->|Remove| E[Remove Data & Index]
    B -->|Add/Update| C[Add Data & Index]
    B -->|Undo| L[Restore from History]

    C --> F[Schedule by SRS Algorithm]
    D --> G[Trie-Based Search]
    G --> J[Paginated Results]
    L --> M[Revert Changes]

    I[Record Change] --> K[Enable Undo]
    F --> I
    E --> I
```


### CLI Interface
- **Interactive Mode**: Full-featured interactive CLI
- **Batch Mode**: Execute commands directly from command line arguments
- **Alias Support**: Multiple command aliases for convenience (e.g., `ls`, `rm`, `cfg`)
- **Clear Output**: Well-formatted, readable command output with proper pagination


## SRS Algorithm

LeetSolv implements a customized SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm that adapts review intervals based on problem importance, familiarity, and memory usage. The algorithm ensures that critical problems are reviewed more frequently while allowing easier problems to have longer intervals.

### Interval Growth by Importance Level

The following graphs demonstrate how review intervals grow over time for different importance levels, showing the adaptive nature of the scheduling system:

![SM2 Critical](document/image/SM2_CRITICAL.png)
**Critical Problems**: Shortest intervals with frequent reviews to ensure mastery of the most important concepts.

![SM2 High](document/image/SM2_HIGH.png)
**High Importance**: Moderate intervals balancing frequency with efficiency for important problems.

![SM2 Medium](document/image/SM2_MEDIUM.png)
**Medium Importance**: Standard intervals following classic SM-2 progression for regular practice.

![SM2 Low](document/image/SM2_LOW.png)
**Low Importance**: Longer intervals for problems that require less frequent review.

> Algorithm parameters can be adjusted in the configuration file in future versions.

## Architecture

### Zero Dependencies Philosophy
**üöÄ Pure Go Implementation**: LeetSolv is built entirely in Go without any external dependencies. This approach offers several advantages:

- **DSA Learning**: Implement every data structure and algorithm from scratch for deep understanding
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune implementations beyond theoretical complexity (e.g., heap operations use O(log n) instead of O(log n) + O(log n))
- **Full Control**: Complete visibility and control over every algorithm's behavior
- **Easy Customization**: Developers can easily modify the SRS algorithm or create clones in other languages
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning how algorithms work in practice rather than just using them
